![OpenStack Logo](openstack_logo.png){width=35%}

OpenStack is an open-source software platform for cloud computing, enabling the creation and management of public and private cloud infrastructures. It is designed to be scalable and flexible, providing a robust solution for managing computing, storage, and networking resources. OpenStack is used by a wide variety of organizations, from small businesses to large corporations and cloud service providers. 🌐

## OpenStack Modules 🚀

OpenStack is composed of a series of modules that integrate to offer a complete cloud solution. Some of the most important modules are:

- **Nova**: Provides computing services, allowing the management of virtual machines. It is the central component for managing compute instances.
- **Neutron**: Offers networking services, managing networks and IP addresses. It allows the creation of complex networks and the assignment of IPs to instances.
- **Cinder**: Provides block storage services, allowing the management of storage volumes. It is ideal for databases and applications that require persistent storage.
- **Swift**: Offers object storage, allowing the storage and retrieval of unstructured data. It is highly scalable and suitable for storing large amounts of data.
- **Glance**: Provides image management services, allowing the management of disk images. It facilitates the creation and maintenance of operating system images.
- **Keystone**: Offers identity services, managing user authentication and authorization. It is the central security component of OpenStack.
- **Horizon**: Provides a graphical user interface for managing OpenStack. It allows users to interact with OpenStack through a web browser.
- **Heat**: Offers orchestration services, allowing the management of infrastructure as code. It facilitates the automation of resource deployment.
- **Ceilometer**: Provides telemetry services, allowing the monitoring and measurement of resources. It is useful for billing and performance monitoring.
