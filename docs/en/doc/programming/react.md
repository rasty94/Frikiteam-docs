# React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of developers.

## Main Features

- **Component-Based**: Create encapsulated components that manage their own state and combine them to create complex interfaces.
- **Declarative**: React makes it very easy to create interactive user interfaces. Design simple views for each state of your application and React will efficiently update and render the correct components when data changes.
- **Virtual DOM**: Thanks to the Virtual DOM, React minimizes costly updates to the real DOM.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

- `useState`: For local state management.
- `useEffect`: For handling side effects (API calls, subscriptions).
- `useContext`: For accessing context without nesting.
